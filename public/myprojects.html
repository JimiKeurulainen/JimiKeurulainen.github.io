<h2 style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US>This website</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This website itself is a project of mine. I
have made this from scratch with React native, though it is still a work in
progress. The website is hosted with GitHub pages, and the custom domain is
provided by Namecheap. Both services were free through their student
programs/discounts, so I naturally opted for them. The code documentation of
this project can be found on my GitHub page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I initially had some issues getting GitHub
pages working. There was quite a lot of tinkering with React on GitHub pages,
including 3<sup>rd</sup> party npm packages, namely <i>gh-pages.</i></span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Keeping the Website Up to Date </span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The text you are reading currently was
written at first in Microsoft Word, mainly because I find it to be easiest way
to write long, coherent pieces of text. After writing the parts that I want to
add, I use the <i>find and replace</i> function in Word to insert HTML tags
appropriately to different parts of the text. I then copy-paste this text to a
JavaScript file that binds the HTML string into a variable. I then import this
variable into the corresponding React Component and parse it using React's <i>DangerouslySetInnerHTML
</i>-tag. This tag, like its name suggests, can be exploited through Cross Site
Scripting -attacks if not used carefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I believe that I don't have any sensitive
information on this website that could be exploited through XSS, but it is
better to be safe than sorry. XSS can be avoided using HTML sanitization, so I
installed a package called <i>DOMPurify</i>, that includes sanitization
functions that can be used to sanitize the input HTML.</span></p>
