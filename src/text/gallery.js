My name is Jimi Keurulainen, and I am a third-year ICT-engineering student from Turku University of Applied Sciences. I have made this website as an extension to my resume, and Iâ€™ll go through my own projects and such in more depth on this website. This site will also serve as a kind of a blog/documentation platform for myself and my projects.

This website itself is a project of mine. I have made this from scratch with React native, though it is still a work in progress.
